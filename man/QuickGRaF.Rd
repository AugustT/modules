\title{Model module: QuickGRaF}
\usage{
QuickGRaF(.df, l = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.df}{\strong{Internal parameter, do not use in the workflow function}. \code{.df} is data frame that combines the occurrence data and covariate data. \code{.df} is passed automatically in workflow from the process module(s) to the model module(s) and should not be passed by the user.}

\item{l}{lengthscale parameter, a positive number controlling the complexity
of the fitted model with respect to each covariate.
Can either be a single number (in which case it is used for all covariates),
a vector of numbers of the same length as the number of covariates,
or \code{NULL} in which case GRaF will calculate a fixed approximation to
a sensible lengthscale.}
}

Model module to fit a quick GRaF model, without parameter optimisation.
